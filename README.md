Assignments for labs 1-4 were made on the same project, graphs1. The following problems were solved for these labs:

1. Designed and implemented the abstract data type Directed Graph with costs
2. Finding a lowest length path between two given vertices, by using a forward breadth-first search from the starting vertex.
3. Given a graph with costs and two vertices, find a lowest cost walk between the given vertices, or print a message if there are negative cost cycles accessible from the starting vertex. The program uses the Ford's algorithm.
4. Given a graph with costs, does the following:
  
  ·verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting using the algorithm based on predecessor counters;
  
  ·if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices, in O(m+n).
  
For lab 5, the projects graphs2 was made. It solves this problem: Given an undirected graph, find a Hamiltonian cycle (if it exists).
